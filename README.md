# Renovate Integrations

This is a collection of configurations for automating dependency upgrades with [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).

## Get Started

### JavaScript

_In an effort to minimize duplication, we won't repeat what the [Renovate JS docs](https://docs.renovatebot.com/javascript/) already note. Other
information will be NerdWallet-specific._

For testing renovate locally, you can run something like,

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/renovate --token=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
