# Renovate Integrations

This is a collection of configurations for automating dependency upgrades with [Renovate].

## Get Started

_In an effort to minimize duplication, we won't repeat what Renovate has already documented, for example the [Renovate JS docs]. We'll try to focus on NerdWallet-specific info._

Renovate will support most languages we use at NerdWallet, including:
- Python
- Go
- JavaScript

### Local Testing

Until we've widespread adoption, we'll be opting in to repos.

For local testing, you can isolate specific repos in

```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  repositories: [
    // Any github repo e.g. NerdWallet/yak; case sensitive.
  ],
};
```

 and then invoke Renovate with a [GitHub personal access token][Renovate PAT],

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/renovate --token=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

This should open a PR against that repo in question. See the [Renovate onboard PR] for more details.
